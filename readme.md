 # WS-011: Windows Server 2019 Administration

- **[Download Latest Student Handbook and AllFiles Content](../../releases/latest)**
- **Are you a MCT?** - Have a look at our [GitHub User Guide for MCTs](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/MCT-User-Guide/)
- **Need to manually build the lab instructions?** - Instructions are available in the [MicrosoftLearning/Docker-Build](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/Docker-Build) repository

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, like other MOC courses, we are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub. However, unlike many of our other Azure courses, this Windows Server course doesn't use any Azure services, and so it's not subject to changes due to updates in the Azure platform. The files are provided on GitHub as a way to track things that need to be corrected. For typographical errors in the labs we will generally align those with changes made to the student handbook on a quarterly basis.

## How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?

- The instructor handbook and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source for teaching the course content.

- These files on GitHub are designed to be used in conjunction with the student handbook, but are in GitHub as a central repository so MCTs and course authors can have a shared source for the latest lab files.

## What about changes to the student handbook?

- We will review the student handbook on a quarterly basis and update through the normal MOC release channels as needed.

## What can I do if I encounter errors in the lab instructions?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

## Notes

### Classroom Materials

It is strongly recommended that MCTs and Partners access these materials and in turn, provide them separately to students.  Pointing students directly to GitHub to access Lab steps as part of an ongoing class will require them to access yet another UI as part of the course, contributing to a confusing experience for the student. Microsoft Learning support for accessing files on GitHub and support for navigation of the GitHub site is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
